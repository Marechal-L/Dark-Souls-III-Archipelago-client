## Troubleshoots
- The provided dll requires other dependencies so if you encounter a crash when launching the game,
installing the latest Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable version could fix it : https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe.
- The Windows console tends to freeze preventing you from sending or receiving any items. You must Alt+Tab, click on the console and press enter to refresh it.
